# MediaCMS Moodle Plugin

This plugin is an open-source Moodle plugin for integrating **MediaCMS**  
(https://mediacms.io/) with Moodle.

After setting up your MediaCMS server, you can add a **MediaCMS activity** in Moodle  
and simply provide the **MediaCMS video URL** in the activity settings.

This allows Moodle courses to easily embed and use videos hosted on a MediaCMS server.
